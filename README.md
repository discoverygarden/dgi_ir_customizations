# DGI IR Customizations

## Introduction

Modules and functionality added to Discoverygarden's Institutional Repository
implementation.

**N.B.** Functionality here is branched from the original `dgi_ir` project;
pieces of that module migrated to here were considered integral to DGI's
Institutional Repository implementation rather than integral to Research Output
itself. As such, this module _must be left public_.

## Requirements

This module requires the following modules/libraries:

* [Islandora Institutional Repository](https://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora_institutional_repository)

## Installation

Install as
[usual](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/extending-drupal-8/installing-drupal-8-modules).

## Usage

### Additional Media Redirect

A checkbox has been added to the Media creation page that allows the creation of
additional media. You will be asked the type of media to create (by default,
binary objects).
